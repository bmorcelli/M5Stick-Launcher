## tips
* Having an SD card is good for better experience, but not really needed. [SDCard Hat for M5StickCs](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:6459069) 
* You can learn more about how it works o [Launcher Wiki](https://github.com/bmorcelli/Launcher/wiki/Explaining-the-project).
* Where/How do I find Binaries to launch -> [Obtaining binaries to launch](https://github.com/bmorcelli/Launcher/wiki/Obtaining-binaries-to-launch)
* Now you can download binaries from [HERE!](https://bmorcelli.github.io/Launcher/m5lurner.html)

## How to Install
* Use the Flasher: [Launcher Flasher](https://bmorcelli.github.io/Launcher/).
* Use M5Burner, or
* Download the .bin file from Releases for your device and use https://web.esphome.io/ or esptool.py and flash the file: `Launcher-{ver}-{YourDevice}.bin` into your device.

## How to Use
* Turn your Device on
* Press M5 (Enter) in the Launcher Start Screen to start Launcher
* Choose OTA to install new binaries from M5Burner repo
* After installed, when turn on the device, if you don't press anything, the installed program will be launched.


## Known Issues
* UiFlow 1 doesn´t work with Launcher.. it uses an old MicroPython distro, that uses an old ESP-IDF distro with lots os secrets that I couldn´t figure out.

## To-Do list
Things that needs to be done in next updates
